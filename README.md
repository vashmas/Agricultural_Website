 Agricultural Website - Agrinova Group of Companies 
 
📌 Project Overview

Agrinova Group of Companies is a modern, multi-page agricultural website developed to showcase agricultural products, crops, company information, and career opportunities in a professional and user-friendly way.

The website is designed with a clean UI, responsive layout, and interactive features such as sidebar navigation, dynamic buttons, and integrated contact options.
